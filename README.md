## Description
This project is a application that runs in the browser and is using heroku to run the server. This application also uses webpack to bundle together and configure the javascript to work for the browser. I learned a lot about how webpack plugins work and how each property of the plugin effects the look and function of the browser. 

## Usage
To use this application follow the link [here](https://pwatexteditor512.herokuapp.com/) to view the app on the heroku hosted server.

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.
